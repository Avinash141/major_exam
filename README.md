# MLOps Major Assignment

## Description

This project implements a comprehensive MLOps pipeline demonstrating the complete machine learning lifecycle from model training to deployment. The system features a Linear Regression model with manual quantization implementation, automated testing, and CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions.

**Key Features:**
- **Model Training**: Automated Linear Regression training with performance evaluation
- **Manual Quantization**: Custom 8-bit quantization implementation for model compression
- **Prediction Pipeline**: Inference system with comprehensive performance metrics
- **Testing Framework**: Unit tests ensuring code reliability and model performance
- **Containerization**: Docker support for consistent deployment environments
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and validation through GitHub Actions

The project showcases modern MLOps practices including model versioning, automated testing, containerization, and continuous integration, making it suitable for production deployment scenarios.

## Comparison Table
